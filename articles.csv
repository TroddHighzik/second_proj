I am genuinely excited about the prospect  of working with you and contributing to the success of our endeavors. However, I find myself in a situation that I believe I need to bring to your attention.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to  commence work until approximately one week from today (28th October 2023). I  understand the importance of starting promptly, and I genuinely value your time and  the trust you've placed in me. I want to assure you that this delay is not a reflection of my commitment to this  project. On the contrary, I am enthusiastic and fully dedicated to delivering my best  work once I start. The extra time will allow me to prepare and ensure that I am wellequipped to meet and even exceed your expectations. I kindly request your understanding and patience in this matter. If there are any  specific tasks or preparations I can make during this period to make up for the delay,  please don't hesitate to let me know. I am committed to ensuring that this brief delay  does not impact the progress of our project once I am on board.",troddhighzik@gmail.com,2023-10-22 17:32:05
